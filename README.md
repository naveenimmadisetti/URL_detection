# URL_detection
Malicious URL Detection using the Convolutional Neural Networks
Work- Plan:
1 - Find the Data set based on which URL's that which the model want to classify.
2 - Know minimum set of Features for which the model can classify efficiently.
3 - Construct the Neural Network Model that can take the refined feed and produce the Classification.
4 - Project the results.
